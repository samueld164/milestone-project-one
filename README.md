# Milestone Project One: Personal Portfolio Website

For my first Milestone Project, I have opted to create a personal portfolio website, showcasing the skills that I have learnt throughout the initial modules. The aim is to build a simple, yet informative website, which can be developed over time as more projects that I create can be shown. 

As per the requirements set for this Milestone Project, I have to ensure I adhere to the following:
1. Static front end project: Write custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.
2. Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (using Bootsrap to accomplish this).
3. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
4. Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
5. Attribution: Maintain a clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources. Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and in the README.
6. Deployment: Deploy final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

# H3 UX Design Process

**STRATEGY**

**Objective:** To create an enganging, professional, and easy-to-navigate online portfolio site that highlights my skills, experience and unique value proposition, attracting recruiters and employers to approach me for potential job opportunities. 
The primary audience will be recruiters, hiring managers and potential employers, that need quick access to my qualifications and skills, whilst providing a visually appealing site and easy-to-navigate content.
