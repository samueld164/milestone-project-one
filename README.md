# Milestone Project One: Personal Portfolio Website

For my first Milestone Project, I have opted to create a personal portfolio website, showcasing the skills that I have learnt throughout the initial modules. The aim is to build a simple, yet informative website, which can be developed over time as more projects that I create can be shown. 

As per the requirements set for this Milestone Project, I have to ensure I adhere to the following:
1. Static front end project: Write custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.
2. Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (using Bootsrap to accomplish this).
3. Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.
4. Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.
5. Attribution: Maintain a clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources. Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and in the README.
6. Deployment: Deploy final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.

## Project Example 3: Build a personal portfolio site

External user's goal:
* The site's users are recruiters considering to hire the potential applicant

Site owner's goal:
* Present self in best light and get hired

Potential features to include:
* Tell about educational history and work experience
* Tell about skills and any other relevant competencies and interests
* Provide basic personal information and contact information for recruiters

Advanced potential feature:
* Showcase portfolio or projects so far

## UX Design Process

#### Goals and Audience
* Identify the purpose of the portfolio (e.g. showcase skills, projects, etc.)
* Understand your target audience (e.g. recruiters, potential clients, etc.)

#### Content Strategy
* Decide on key sections: About, Projects, Experience, Contact.
* Prioritise showcase your best work

#### Wireframe and Visual Design

The main purpose of the wesbite is to showcase the content and sources. Meaning the website I have opted for, visually, is simplistic with soft pastel colours, and clear sections relevant to the purpose of the portfolio website. 

Each section will be linked via an anchor, eliminating the creation of multiple tabs when accessing different sections. This will ensure a smoother user experience, delivering the sections in which the audience will want to access with ease.

The website will also be responsive, so that it can be easily accessed via web browser, tablet and mobile devices, without making the formatting too confusing for the viewer.

The colour palette will have a white background with pastel greens to highlight specific sections. The font will Poppins that is easy on the eye throughout all font sizes. 

## Testing & Bug Issues

#### HTML Checker

The first testing I did for the website was via Nu HTML Checker (source: https://validator.w3.org/nu/)

Two checks were made where two errors were found as per the images below.

To clarify, after the first error that was fixed, I added more code to the index.html in the about section, to add the button for the CV file. After that, the second error was found.

After editing the second error, the check came back complete.

#### CSS Checker

With the CSS validator (source: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), multiple errors were found and corrected before deploying the website.

## Credits

The navigation bar was originally sourced from Bootstrapp - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/navbar/, which was then edited to comply to the custom layout for this project and can be seen on the indext.html.

The rest of the coding was learnt from the training modules via Coding Institute.
